APISCAN supports:
- Automated scanning aligned with the OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)
- OpenAPI/Swagger-based  json and YML analysis
- Active endpoint testing
- Improved error handling and modular design
- proxy support add en more 
- need to work on error handeling on apis is very difficult  

This marks a solid foundation for further development, with focus on scalability, accuracy, and extensibility in future versions.
- Beter interface
- Beter error handeling
- Need more tester for help
- work great this version.

## Enhancements:
  - Fully restructured to keep all logic inside the `main()` function:
  - Prevents variable scope issues
  - Clean execution from CLI
  = beter test on false positives

  - extra work to do
  - Logs are saved to timestamped file: `apiscan_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
  - Log output is still limited 
  - Log wil includes connection attempts, warnings, and errors

## Bug Fixes:
-  Fixed `NameError: name 'args' is not defined` caused by code being placed outside `main()`.
-  Nee to add extra logging, next release
-  PDF output
-  Testers for support and comment
-  Speeds scanner for testing, diffcult part for me (many api's has speed limitation

## Notes:
- This version is now suitable for scheduled use, auditing APIs with different authentication schemes.
- Swagger is required for test execution.
- postman to swagger is a new project and live
